    description:
      "Pull-ups are an upper-body exercise that recruits multiple large muscle groups, primarily the muscles in the back and biceps, and uses the body's own weight as resistance. To do a pull-up, grasp a bar overhead and pull your body up to the bar using the strength in your upper body. You may be saying to yourself, \"I can't do a pull-up!\" And while you may not be able to do an unassisted pull-up today, most everyone can do a pull-up using an assisted pull-up machine or a resistance band to help lift part of their body weight through the range of motion. With practice and by building strength, you will make progress. And when you do, the sense of accomplishment you get by doing something difficult will give you a big confidence boost.",

    description:
      "Like pull-ups, push-ups are also primarily an upper-body exercise that recruits multiple large muscle groups and use the body's weight as resistance. Push-ups target the chest, shoulders and triceps muscles, and because your body is in a high plank posture, you also engage your core and legs for stability.\n There are two basic modifications to make push-ups more accessible. The most common modification is to simply drop your knees to the floor and do push-ups from your hands and knees. This is an easy variation that takes some of your body weight out of the equation. You'll want to make sure that you are in a modified (hands and knees) plank posture with your hips forward and body in a straight line from your shoulders to your knees, then lower your body to the floor until your chest touches the ground and push back up into your modified plank again. \n I personally recommend that my clients modify by elevating the upper body onto a bench, a box, a chair or the edge of your desk or table. This elevated push-up modification allows you to remain in a full plank posture with the upper body elevated off of the floor to take some of the weight out of your arms and allow your legs to help you do the work.",

    description:
      "Squats build strength, primarily in the lower body, by working the glutes and the quadriceps muscles. They also recruit the core to stabilize the body throughout the exercise. Squats can be done using only your body weight or can be 'weighted' by adding dumbbells, kettlebells, a barbell or bands to increase the resistance as you continue to build strength. Using a wall to do a wall squat or wall sit provides an excellent modification for those who may have knee pain or who prefer the added support of the wall.",

    description:
      "Deadlifts are one of the most important exercises that you can do to learn how to lift things without hurting your back. It also feels great to be able to lift something heavy. Deadlifts work the muscles in the glutes, hamstrings and core. To reduce the risk of injury with deadlifts, as with all resistance exercises, you'll want to make sure you are using proper form. Start by practicing the movement with no weight. Then add weight slowly as you build strength. Like squats, deadlifts are versatile. You can add weight using dumbbells, a barbell, kettlebells or a trap bar, and there are many progressions and variations to make this exercise accessible.",

    description:
      "A plank is a static posture that engages almost every muscle in the body. It is a core exercise, but also recruits muscles in the upper body and in the lower body. If you can perfect your plank posture, you can perfect your overall standing and seated posture, which research shows is essential to building confidence in ourselves and projecting confidence to others. Planks require no equipment and can be done anywhere. There are number of ways to modify and progress a standard plank. Start by holding a standard plank as long as you are able, using good form, and then work to progress from there. My basic rule for clients is to be able to hold a low plank with good form for one minute before adding any progressions or variations.",
