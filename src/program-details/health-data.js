      "Pushups work multiple muscle groups, strengthening the arms, chest, and shoulders. How to do them: Start in a plank position with the arms straight and the body lifted in a straight line horizontal to the floor. Keep the feet together and the toes flexed to support the body. The palms should be flat on the floor shoulder-width apart, with the fingers facing straight ahead or slightly inward. Keeping the head in line with the spine, slowly bend the elbows outward and lower the body down to the floor. Try to keep the hips and lower back in line. Lower as far as possible, aiming to touch the chest or chin to the floor. Use the arm muscles to press the body back up into the starting position. Keep the abdominal muscles engaged throughout to help support the back.",

      "Running is a form of aerobic exercise, and it can help improve cardiovascular fitness and bone strength. Jogging is a less intense form of running and may be best for beginners. People can often improve their running endurance through interval running, which involves running for a certain distance or time and then switching to walking before running again. Alternatively, people can switch between running and sprinting. Sprint interval training may help decrease body fat, increase aerobic capacity, and increase peak running speed.",

      "Knee tucks work the abdominals, calves, and shins. People will need an exercise ball, sometimes called a stability ball, for this exercise. How to do them: Lie on the stomach on top of the stability ball with the hands and feet on the floor. Walk forward on the hands until the knees are resting on the ball and the feet have lifted off the floor. The hands should be directly underneath the shoulders. Roll the knees forward to curl them into the chest. Slowly push the knees back to return to the starting position.",

Bend the knees into the triceps, close to the armpits, and place both feet behind the hands. The lower inner thighs should rest just above the elbows.
