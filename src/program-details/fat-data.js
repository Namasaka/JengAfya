      "Start in a standing position with your arms resting at your sides. Slightly bend your knees and jump your legs out so they’re a little more than shoulder-width apart. At the same time, thrust your arms out and over your head. Then return your body to your starting position and repeat for 30 seconds of continuous jumping.",

    description:
      "Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. In one fluid motion, lower your body into a squat, place your hands on the ground in front of your feet, and jump your feet back so you land in a plank position. Then jump to return your feet to near your hands and complete a powerful jump straight up into the air. Repeat. To make it more challenging, add a push-up when you’re in the plank position. If you’re a beginner, do a squat thrust instead for lower impact: The move is similar to a burpee, except you don’t complete the explosive jump at the end and simply stand up.",

      "With your feet shoulder-width apart, lower your body into a squat position (back and upper body stay lifted, and hips and butt lower down to the ground as if you’re sitting in an imaginary chair). Keep your core tight and launch into an explosive jump. Land lightly on your feet and immediately lower into a squat again. Repeat.",

    description:
      "Stand with your feet hip-width apart. With your right foot planted, cross your left leg behind you and out to your right side (almost as if you’re doing a curtsy lunge). Your weight should be supported by your right leg. Simultaneously, swing your right arm out to about shoulder height and your left arm across your body reaching toward your right hip. Then jump to your left and repeat the movement on your left side. Land on your left foot and swing your right leg behind you and out to your left side. (Left arm should simultaneously swing out to your left side and right arm should extend toward your left hip.) Continue leaping back and forth with arms swinging in a skating motion.",

      "Begin in a plank position with your wrists in line with your shoulders and your body extended in a straight line behind you. Your feet should be planted together on the floor. Jump your legs out wide, and then jump them back together at a quick pace.",

      "From a standing position, lift your left knee into your chest. Swiftly switch your legs so your right knee is now pulled into your chest. At a nonstop pace, keep alternating your knees and move your arms in a running motion, with your left arm lifting with your right leg and right arm lifting with your left leg.",
